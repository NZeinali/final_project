Final Project

In this project, Machine Learning will be deployed to predict prices for properties in Perth Area. The training and testing data consist of over 25,000 records in csv format with key features including number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, land area, build year, distance to CBD, train station and schools, and sold price.


The supervised learning will be employed to find patterns in the data.

There will be two tasks defined in this project:

1- Predicting the required budget for a property through indication of the required number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, distance to CBD, land area and build year (build year needs to be converted to categorical values, e.g. 2000-2005 and 2005-2010)

2- Predicting affordable suburbs to look for a property by indication of parameters such as available budget, number of bedrooms, build year and land area. For this step, unsupervised learning may be required to get predicted clusters of data.

The outcome app of this analysis will be shared in Heroku.
